Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
