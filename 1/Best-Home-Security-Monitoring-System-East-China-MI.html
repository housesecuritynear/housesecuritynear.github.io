In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly released in public places, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have actually not reduced criminal offense. "Once the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the basic downward pattern in criminal activities and offences," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in certain categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had reduced criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
