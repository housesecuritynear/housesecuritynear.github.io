Many insurer offer discounts on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments provide a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start.
