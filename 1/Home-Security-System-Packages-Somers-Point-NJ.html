<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>Indoor cameras are great for keeping an eye on your kids and pets, however if you're worried about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action.

<p>The main benefit of a home security system is to protect your household, home, and prized possessions when you're away at work, on trip, or asleep. As we've seen, there are numerous alternatives for equipment, monitoring, and installation at various price points.
