You can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort if you're utilizing a home automation center to control things like lighting and thermostats. At the same time, if you do not have a home automation center, look for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively simple to install.
