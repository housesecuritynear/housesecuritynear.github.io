<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
