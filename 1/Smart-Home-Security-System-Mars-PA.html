Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>As for how to use one, they work the like most other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. In some cases you do not even have to hardwire them, depending upon which model you pick. Just like any security system, the more equipment you include, the more expensive it gets. When you include smart cameras to any Blue system, and that price leaps a lot.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply just to NVR systems, however they eliminated other elements that would be required for a DVR system, like extra power sources and the BNC cable televisions utilized to link cameras to the DVR.
