The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
