<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
