When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if required, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
<p>Many full-time" residents with alarm systems tell us that they are home all the time" and wonder why they would require monitoring. However, individuals need to take into consideration the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - instead of just their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not?

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and people. Because carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, the only method to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Luckily, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your house increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also receive push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a problem, even when you're not in your home.</p>
