<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
<p>Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to likewise hear what's going on provides you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. It can also notify you to something occurring out of the camera's visual field. This function can also permit you to speak through the camera, an excellent tool for from another location commanding a rowdy animal or surprising an intruder in the act, however know that you may need to plug in a powered speaker for this function to work.</p>
