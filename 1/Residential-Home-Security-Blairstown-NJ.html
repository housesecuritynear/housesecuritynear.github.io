<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it identified any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system.
