The most common option amongst property owners is WiFi connectivity because they're simple to install and simple to work with. However, house owners with weak internet should not opt for a WiFi-driven system given that the signal will continue to drop and render the security system useless. If WiFi isn't an option, cellular connection is a good alternative. Ethernet cables can connect a system also, but that means cables. Normally, a system with ethernet cable televisions is professionally installed since the wires ought to go through the wall and use a home's electrical grid.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the extra equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>

It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
