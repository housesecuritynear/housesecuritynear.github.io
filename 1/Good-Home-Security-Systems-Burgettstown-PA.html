<h3>Wireless Surveillance System Burgettstown PA 15021</h3>

Any home security camera worth its salt will support motion detection. However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you require to add to a full Vivint home security system.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
