<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
