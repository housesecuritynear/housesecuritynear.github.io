<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your pets and kids, but if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with options for more by means of subscription. Although it does not have the best operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
