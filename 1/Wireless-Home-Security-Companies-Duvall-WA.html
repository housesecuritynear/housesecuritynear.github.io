<p>While every house owner stresses over break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. Practically all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their main communication source.
