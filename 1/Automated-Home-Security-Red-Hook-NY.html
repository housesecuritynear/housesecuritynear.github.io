<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
