Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>When the level of carbon monoxide in your home reaches a hazardous level, a carbon monoxide detector activates. Unlike other environmental threats, you can not see, taste, or smell carbon monoxide gas. These detectors can save your life and those of your family pets. Carbon monoxide is released when you burn gas, wood, oil, charcoal, gas, and natural gas, so homes with gas appliances, chimneys, wood-burning ranges, and linked garages have a greater need for carbon monoxide detectors.
