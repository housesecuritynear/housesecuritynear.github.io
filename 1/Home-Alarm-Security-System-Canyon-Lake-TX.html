The cameras spent weeks protecting our front door, notifying us to pals, member of the family, shipment people, and even the milkman. As soon as we got a sufficient look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection outside for another two weeks to see what type of outcomes we would get when the cameras faced your house throughout the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
