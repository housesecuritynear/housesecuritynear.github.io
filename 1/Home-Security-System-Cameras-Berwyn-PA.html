<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
