<h3>Home Camera Surveillance Santa Rosa Beach FL 32459</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
