This suggests they generally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering things and individuals to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for trying to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear correctly exposed and in full information. If a camera can not catch and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night, it has actually limited effectiveness.</p>
