<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more costly overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some home security systems that help protect the home versus things like carbon monoxide gas leaks and fires. Take GetSafe as an example.
