<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I would not suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and requiring time off from work. Contacting a technician costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert deal with the task and do not mind spending the additional money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the type of cameras they are offering to the public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
