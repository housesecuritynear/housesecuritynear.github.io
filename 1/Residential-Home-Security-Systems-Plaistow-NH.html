<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
