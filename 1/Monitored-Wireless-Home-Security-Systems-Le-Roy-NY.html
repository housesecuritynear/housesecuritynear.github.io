<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches use just to NVR systems, but they cut out other parts that would be essential for a DVR system, like extra power sources and the BNC cable televisions utilized to link cameras to the DVR.

When picking which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the greatest factor to consider.
