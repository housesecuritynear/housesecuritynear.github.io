<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. Do alarm systems account for burglary decreases in the United States?
