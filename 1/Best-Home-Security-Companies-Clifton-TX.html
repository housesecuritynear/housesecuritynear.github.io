<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors secure your security system versus transient surges that can go into through Air Conditioner power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones.

<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments provide a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
