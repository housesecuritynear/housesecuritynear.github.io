<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system versus short-term rises that can get in through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones. It's not just about security from theft, either.

We've found good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brand names offered. Often you do not have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT provide only expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a Do It Yourself alternative.
