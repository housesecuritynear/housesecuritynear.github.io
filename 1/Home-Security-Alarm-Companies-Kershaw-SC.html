<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
