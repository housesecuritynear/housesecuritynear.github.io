CCTV security cameras, otherwise referred to as closed-circuit tv, are a system of video feeds within a closed system readily available only to licensed users.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens.

This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
