Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by.
