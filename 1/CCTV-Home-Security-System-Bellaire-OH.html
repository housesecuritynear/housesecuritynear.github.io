Guidelines are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and how long are they retained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and enforced; and what punishments would apply to violators.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
