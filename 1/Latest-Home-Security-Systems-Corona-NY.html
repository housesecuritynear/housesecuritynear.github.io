<p>Wired: Each camera is linked to a recording system, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - especially if your home has actually already been constructed - so make certain to talk to an expert before handling the job yourself.

Wired systems are a better alternative since they can support more cameras if you have a large home or property that needs detailed protection.</p>
