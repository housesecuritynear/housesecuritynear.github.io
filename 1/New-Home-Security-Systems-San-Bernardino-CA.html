<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
