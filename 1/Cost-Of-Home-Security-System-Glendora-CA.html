Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
