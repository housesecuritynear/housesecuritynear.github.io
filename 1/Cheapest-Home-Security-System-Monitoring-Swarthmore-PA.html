If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
