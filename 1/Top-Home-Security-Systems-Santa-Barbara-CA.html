<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we tested, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription.

And in spite of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
