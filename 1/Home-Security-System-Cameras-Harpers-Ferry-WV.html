Now, the majority of security systems include a great number of parts, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other parts.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes use just to NVR systems, but they eliminated other components that would be necessary for a DVR system, like extra power sources and the BNC cables utilized to link cameras to the DVR. Rather, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you've got a power source and a way of sending data to your NVR all in one bundle. The greatest consideration when choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next factor to consider is how likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
