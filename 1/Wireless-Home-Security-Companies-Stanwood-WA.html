<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months.
