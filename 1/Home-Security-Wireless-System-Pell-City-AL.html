If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
