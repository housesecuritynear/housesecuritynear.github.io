In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensing unit. Anything included extra you would own but if you don't restore their high priced strategy they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm.

<p>This being Ring, the app is polished and expert too, and if you want to see what your camera is shooting then you can get the video up on an Echo Show or a Fire TV gadget with a simple Alexa voice command. I hear this all the time in my everyday operations management of American Alarm Systems.
