Your system can act as a hub for up to 119 clever home gadgets, and can be managed by means of Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more.

Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a different power source, suggesting a more complex setup and more wires. PoE switches are likewise normally considered a more secure way to send data.</p>
