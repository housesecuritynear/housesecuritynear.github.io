<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
