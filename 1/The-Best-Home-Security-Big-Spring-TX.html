Not to discuss the recent changes in phone services, like (VOIP) Voice over web protocol which are not a dependable kind of communication for alarm or any data transmission, most of the time preventing alarm signals from going through to the central station. Phone networks were not initially developed with security in mind. Any of these problems could prevent your important alarm messages from reaching the main station, emergency situation, authorities, and fire reaction personnel.</p>
