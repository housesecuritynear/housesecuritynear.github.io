Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
