<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
