<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a number of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Lots of insurance companies offer discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments use a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
