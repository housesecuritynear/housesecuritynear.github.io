In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
