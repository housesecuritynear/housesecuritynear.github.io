Since it comes with numerous door and window sensing units for full coverage, we recommend the eight-piece set. We also suggest adding a doorbell video camera eventually.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
