<p>The Abode Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some individuals. Home has actually upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better range for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the Abode Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we evaluated that also works with HomeKit. We've experienced a few technical issues while long-term screening the Abode Iota, therefore will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer advise it.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>Nest is pricier than the majority of other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you wish to monitor your system yourself.

Vivint's equipment is the most technologically advanced of all the security companies on our list. Its clever home panel lets the system learn your routines, so it knows when to turn up the heat or dim the lights based upon your routine and preferences. And Vivint consists of full access to its mobile app with every bundle-- a perk that a lot of companies make you pay for.</p>

<p>Really merely, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get a notice to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you desire a doorbell noise too.)
