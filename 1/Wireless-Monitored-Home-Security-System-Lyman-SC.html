<p>The Abode Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some individuals.

When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
