<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we liked it as a pet cam ). It has because been improved and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home combination alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>To be beneficial, an intrusion alarm system is deactivated or reconfigured when authorized workers exist. Authorization may be suggested in any number of methods, typically with keys or codes used at the control panel or a remote panel near an entry.
