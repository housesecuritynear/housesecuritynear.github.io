<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature.

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop.

Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment however so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the very best functions on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (along with more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
