<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature.

Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment however so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the very best functions on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (along with more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
