<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". Most wireless home security systems are DIY and simple to connect using 'how-to' videos or the provider's manual. Although you won't have a professional install your security equipment, you'll conserve cash from installation costs. And when you're all set to move, just pack up your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or scheduling a specialist. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during heavy traffic.
