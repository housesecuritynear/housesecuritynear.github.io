<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
