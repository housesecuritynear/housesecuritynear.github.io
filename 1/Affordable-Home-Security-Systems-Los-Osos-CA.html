<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 services, universities, and government facilities, and residential consumers. A basic system will usually only include the control board, sensing units, and an audible alarm. If you want any other features, you will either need to buy an advanced plan or add-on to your basic system, which, depending upon the brand name, could get expensive. There are several reasons that you should opt for a home security (security systems, security alarm) company that has a local existence in the Kent, WA location. Vivint is for you if you desire a perfectly designed security system that works even better than it looks. That is with the caution that you're also a homeowner, and you do not mind spending for expert installation. Tenants, look away, this one's not your best option.</p>
<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing rate and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though, Vivint is not a Do It Yourself system-- it does require professional installation. Also, the equipment is a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you spend for. Thankfully, their monthly monitoring cost is on-par with other top brand names. These include practical issues such as how the camera is powered and installed, the specifications and functions of the camera itself, and additional features, perks, and manages that the system might have.
