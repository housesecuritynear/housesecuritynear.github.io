<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
