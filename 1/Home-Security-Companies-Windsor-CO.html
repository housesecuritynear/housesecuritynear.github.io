Outdoor security cameras can hinder criminals and provide an early caution prior to someone enters your home.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before buying.</p>

Calling in a specialist costs more, however for those who prefer to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind spending the money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
