<p>We searched for DIY systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer greatly reduced or free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile.

<p>It's becoming more popular. However for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that provides two-way audio, go for it.
