It also comes with 2 days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system.
