<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Kansas</h3>
<p>Frontpoint provides five packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester went with the Interactive plan however wound up dissatisfied with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on vacation, she had no chance of determining whether her home had actually been broken into or if her feline had managed to trip the sensor. It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>The system is an ideal choice for homes and companies, featuring optional growth up to eight HD security cameras and full HD 1080p resolution. Alarm monitoring is not just an affordable method to protect your home or business from burglary, medical and fire emergency situations, but it may pay for itself!

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
