Now, a lot of security systems involve a variety of components, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other components. But I also value minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all easily communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
