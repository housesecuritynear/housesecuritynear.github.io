<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
