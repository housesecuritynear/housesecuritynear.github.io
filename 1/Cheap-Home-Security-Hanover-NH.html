As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
