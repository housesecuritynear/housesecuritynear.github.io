<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
