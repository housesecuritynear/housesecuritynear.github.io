<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We think that's pricey.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
