Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and in full detail.
