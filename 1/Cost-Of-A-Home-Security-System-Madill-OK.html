<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Terrific clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease.

<p>One category where SimpliSafe has actually gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer care. Due to the fact that they can regularly result in additional charges, most users are not extremely pleased with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms. Furthermore, the overall opinion is that the company's customer service is not very useful when it concerns recurring and repairing problems usage issues.

<p>Saving uncompressed digital recordings uses up an enormous quantity of hard disk space, and a few hours of uncompressed video might rapidly fill a disk drive.
