<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
