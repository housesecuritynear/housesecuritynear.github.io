<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location.

During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
