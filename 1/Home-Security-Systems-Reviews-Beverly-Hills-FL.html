<p>In 2019, the scenario has changed: home security systems have grown both more highly sophisticated and easy to use, increasing their accuracy and minimizing the threat of incorrect alarms.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>Recommendation: Please remember to provide us a call if you want us to test your alarm. We will react to validate that it is in reality a test. No fine is imposed for this kind of authorities reaction. While we like the House Iota security hub, it comes with just one entry sensing unit, which means you can't protect more than a single door or window.

Most importantly, this security company does not utilize high-pressure sales, so you will not end up paying for more security than you need.</p>
