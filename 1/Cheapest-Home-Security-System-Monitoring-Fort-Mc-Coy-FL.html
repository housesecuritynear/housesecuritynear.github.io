<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and includes a convenient mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the price, and most importantly, it features free cloud storage (up to two hours in total).

Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service means you do not get alerted till the next day?

A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
