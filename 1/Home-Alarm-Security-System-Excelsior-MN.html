<h2>Home Alarm System Limitations Excelsior</h2>
<p>The majority of home security cameras perform the exact same basic functions-- they identify an occasion, record the occasion, and send you an alert-- but they do not all perform them the very same method. And some cameras have special features that surpass those essentials.

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
