<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
