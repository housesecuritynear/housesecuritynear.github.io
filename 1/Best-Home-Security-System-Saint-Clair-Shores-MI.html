<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

<p>A lot of security cameras can be utilized both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the exact same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they differ in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras ought to be weather resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most durable.
