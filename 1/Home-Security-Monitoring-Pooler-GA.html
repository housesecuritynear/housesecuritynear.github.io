<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>Cloud recording: Lots of makers offer cloud storage plans with their camera. With among these, your taped video is sent to a remote server and kept for an established time-- usually anywhere from 24 hr to a week-- and then erased to make space for new videos. Though in some cases free, these cloud plans typically require a monthly membership, however deserve it both for their benefit and if you want a surveillance record during a holiday or other prolonged time far from home.</p>
