<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative clever home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
