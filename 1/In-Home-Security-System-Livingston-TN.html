<p>The majority of security cameras can be utilized both indoors and outdoors. They typically have the same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in durability. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in some cases, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most long lasting.
