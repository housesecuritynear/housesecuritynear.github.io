In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public places, sociologists studying the concern have actually discovered that they have not minimized criminal activity. "Once the crime and offense figures were adapted to take account of the general down trend in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in specific categories however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had minimized crime in general in the city centre."

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
