It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
