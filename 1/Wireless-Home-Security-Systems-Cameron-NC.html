<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
