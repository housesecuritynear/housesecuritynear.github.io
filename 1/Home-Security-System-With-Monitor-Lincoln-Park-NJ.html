That's still substantial, however it's a lot less than the average loss of a burglary.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
