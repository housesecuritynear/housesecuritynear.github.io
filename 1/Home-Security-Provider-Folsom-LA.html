<p>The Wyze Web cam can likewise catch video to the cloud, but the totally free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
