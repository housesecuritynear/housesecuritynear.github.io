If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.
