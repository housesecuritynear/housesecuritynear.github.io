<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Simply put, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to manage your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous signals. Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, e-mail, text, or web portal. If your wireless home security system is professionally monitored, they'll likewise get an alert to instantly help you with emergency responders as required.</p>
