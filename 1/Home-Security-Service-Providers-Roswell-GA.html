<p>A societal consensus about how cameras must be used is necessary, but in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the 4th Modification to the United States Constitution offers some protection versus video searches carried out by the cops, there are presently no general, legally enforceable guidelines to restrict personal privacy invasions and safeguard against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and the length of time are they maintained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other government companies, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and implemented; and what punishments would use to violators.</p>

<p>We tried to find Do It Yourself systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer complimentary or greatly reduced hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals may want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
<p>Local storage: Some cameras consist of memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can save video right on the device. It's an attractive function as it can remove the cost of monthly storage fees. The disadvantage (if there isn't a cloud backup) is that if a crook steals your camera, he takes your forensic evidence with it.
