<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your pets and kids, however if you're worried about security, you do not wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with options for more by means of membership. Despite the fact that it does not have the best operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
