<p>You might invest a comparable quantity for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring. One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which might be an affordable option for clients in rural areas. We advise cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
