<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
