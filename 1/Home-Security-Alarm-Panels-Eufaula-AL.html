The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the harmful assaulter to tape these codes and utilize various cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system.
