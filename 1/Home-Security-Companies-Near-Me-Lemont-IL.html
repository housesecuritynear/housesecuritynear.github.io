Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
