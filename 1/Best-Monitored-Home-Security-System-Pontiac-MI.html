Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly.

Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
