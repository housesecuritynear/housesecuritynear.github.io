<p>The biggest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera.

This generally involves finding a spot for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is usually open or generally closed.
