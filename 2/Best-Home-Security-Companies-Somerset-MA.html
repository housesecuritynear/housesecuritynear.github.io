<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
