<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Fantastic clarity. I wanted to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for example.
