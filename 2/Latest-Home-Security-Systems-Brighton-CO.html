Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
