<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space.

<h3>Good Home Security Systems in Florida</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would alert users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the issue. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

The disadvantage (if there isn't a cloud backup) is that if a crook takes your camera, he takes your forensic proof with it. SimpliSafe clients get contract-free security systems without any cancellation costs. Wi-Fi cameras are terrific for security but also far more.

So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.
