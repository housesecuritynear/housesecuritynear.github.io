<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". Wish to include a flood sensing unit? A smart door lock? Your system can act as a center for as much as 119 wise home gadgets, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and offers power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a separate power source, suggesting a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are likewise typically considered as a more secure method to send information.</p>
<p>If a worker (trusted entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.

However, there work countermeasures (like disabling open switchports during switch configuration and VLAN setup to restrict network access) that are available to secure both the details and the network it includes, however such countermeasures must be applied uniformly to all network devices.</p>
