It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
