<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
