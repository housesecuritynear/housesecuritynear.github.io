Although it does not have the best operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug.

<p>Wireless security cameras being checked in a Customer Reports laboratory. If you do come across a home intrusion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm.
