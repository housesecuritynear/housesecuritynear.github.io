You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself."

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
