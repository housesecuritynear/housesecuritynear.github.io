<p>While every property owner stresses over burglaries, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often leading to incorrect alarms. Do alarm systems represent burglary declines in the United States? The U.S. break-in rate has decreased progressively and substantially given that the early 1980s. 13 During the exact same time, the variety of properties with alarms increased, but there is no proof of a link in between the 2.
