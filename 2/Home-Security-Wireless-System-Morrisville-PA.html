<p>Are alarms a efficient and effective way to capture burglars? Although burglary remains among the most often reported criminal offenses, the clearance rate for U.S. break-ins has remained listed below 15 percent for several years. 14 Clearly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to resolving break-in cases is modest, at best.
