<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Most wireless home security systems are DIY and easy to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have an expert install your security equipment, you'll save money from installation expenses. And when you're prepared to move, just evacuate your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or setting up a professional. In the London train battles in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during rush hour. After the terrible attacks, police examined CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, bring knapsacks filled with dynamites. The terrorists were taped on several CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither noticed nor intercepted prior to they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
