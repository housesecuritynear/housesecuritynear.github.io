Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Pricing - Vivint isn't one of the most affordable cost options. A complete choice of equipment will cost around $2,000, and there's no money-back warranty after 3 days. You can spread the cost of the in advance financial investment over a chosen amount of time, but if you do so, you'll need to sign-up to a service strategy rather than pay-as-you-go (a 100% early cancellation charge would apply to that agreement).
