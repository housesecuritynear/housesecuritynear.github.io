<p>Houston homeowners have alternatives when it concerns home security systems. You can choose a nationally recognized brand name or choose a local company. Both provide comparable offerings, but if you believe there's a possibility you may leave the Houston area in the future, you might be better off partnering with a national brand name that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in an entirely wire-free component. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's features, consisting of 2K recording, two-way audio, and an integrated siren. Also like the camera, it needs an Arlo Smart subscription to store video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
