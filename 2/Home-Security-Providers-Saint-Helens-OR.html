<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen.
