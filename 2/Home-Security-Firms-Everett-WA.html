<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range problems.</p>
