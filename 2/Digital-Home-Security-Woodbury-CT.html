<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and use 2 AA batteries that can last approximately 2 years. Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.
