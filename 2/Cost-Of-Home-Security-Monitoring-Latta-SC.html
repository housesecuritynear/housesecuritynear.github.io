Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>

When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
