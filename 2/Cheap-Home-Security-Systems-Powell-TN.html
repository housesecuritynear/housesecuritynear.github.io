Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and sometimes, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices since their style allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. This will offer more precise and less regular alerts because oftentimes the motion detection is triggered by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
