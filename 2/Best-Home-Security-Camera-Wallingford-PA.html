<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
