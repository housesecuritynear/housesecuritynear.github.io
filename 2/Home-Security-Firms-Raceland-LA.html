Do It Yourself: Many individuals delight in the do-it-yourself aspect of smart alarms, considering that they can select the innovation and elements that they feel best satisfies their requirements. These days, there's a lot to consider when assembling a video surveillance system.

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in customer reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are simple to work with, it's a little a letdown that you can't integrate this camera with any smart home hubs or devices.
