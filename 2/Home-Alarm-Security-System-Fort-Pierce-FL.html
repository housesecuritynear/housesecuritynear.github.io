<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
