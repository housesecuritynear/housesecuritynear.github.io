If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any customer in the network that understands the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>
