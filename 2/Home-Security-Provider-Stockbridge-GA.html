<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough.

Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
