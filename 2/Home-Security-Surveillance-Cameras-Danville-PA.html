Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night.
