<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must offer at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to effectively discover motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with taping gaps throughout crucial security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend among our top picks, but the Arlo is great for signing in on household and family pets-- or stray felines slinking around your lawn.</p>
