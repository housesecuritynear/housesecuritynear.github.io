<p>so state you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I advise to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically very high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in many cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.
