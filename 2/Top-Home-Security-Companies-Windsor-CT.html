<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>

PTZ cameras are from another location controlled, and permit the operator to pan (relocation left or ideal), tilt up and or down, or zoom more detailed or farther away in order to follow people as they move.
