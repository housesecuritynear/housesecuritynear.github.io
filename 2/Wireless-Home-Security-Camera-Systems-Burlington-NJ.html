<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer complimentary" alarm systems are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year agreement. That equipment is paid for within the very first year, but do they reduce your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 monthly rate for at least another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly overpay. Besides paying too much, what if their service is poor? Regrettable, you're caught in their contract.</p>
<p>When the motion sensing unit gets set off, you instantly get informed. Following that, you can choose to either communicate with the burglars by means of the intercom or you can also set off a very loud alarm to scare them away. Arlo Pro 2 can also be incorporated with wise home devices like Apple Homekit, Wink, SmartThings, and others. As such, you can also set off other cautioning functions like switching on all the lights in your house or switching on the speakers and TV.</p>
