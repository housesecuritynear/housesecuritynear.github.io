<p>Nevertheless, convenience does not always include included security. If you don't do it right, going from wired to wireless security means possibly exposing yourself to outside attacks.

<p>Thanks for sharing this great post About Cameras, my viewpoint is everyone should Buy IP Camera due to the fact that advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather misleading on where they are taking a look at.
