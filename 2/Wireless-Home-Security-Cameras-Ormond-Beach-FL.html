<h2>Choosing A Video Surveillance Camera Ormond Beach</h2>

The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
