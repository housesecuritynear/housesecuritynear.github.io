<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
