A self-monitored home limits the potential for incorrect alarms and subsequent charges.</p>

As infrastructure, sensing units and electrical wiring need to be placed inside the walls, which involves drilling and connecting sensing units to low-voltage wires, so there's specialist labor to consider.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
