<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Arlo Pro 2 likewise has a remarkable Night Vision feature. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape videos even in complete darkness. It has about 25 feet of presence at night. As such, even if somebody burglarize your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smartphone app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded video footage will be white and black and a little dark so you might not have the ability to see details plainly.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
