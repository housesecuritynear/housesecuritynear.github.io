<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any client in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This feature automates motion detection when you return or leave to an established location (generally your home). By doing this, you do not have to keep in mind to switch off the camera's monitoring functions each time you get home. For this to work properly, every user in the home (including kids) would need the app set up and geofencing allowed on their phones. We also chose designs that let you disable the automated Away alternative.</p>
