<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

The team will be able to reuse the existing wiring if you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system.
