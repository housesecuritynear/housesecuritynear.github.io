Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
