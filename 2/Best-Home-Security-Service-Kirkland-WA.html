<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those features come at a comparatively steep price: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 30 days of video history.

Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for police action.</p>
