Practically all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; for that reason, if your web decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use a web connection as their main communication source. Many internet connected security systems include a battery backup, which implies if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time. But, if your internet decreases, sadly, you will be without an alarm until it comes back up.</p>
