Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
