<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. On July 1, 2019, Monitronics International - the company that offers sponsorship for Brinks Home Security - declared voluntary personal bankruptcy Under the terms of the new plan, Brinks expects to continue to run usually, providing superior security services without any disruption to their customers, staff members, and partners.
