<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power.</p>

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not so much when you consider that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
