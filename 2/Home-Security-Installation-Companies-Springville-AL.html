HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
