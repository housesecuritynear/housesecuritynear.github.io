If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit.

After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
