<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assaulter, considering that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of information and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being sent. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to tape these codes and utilize various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>
