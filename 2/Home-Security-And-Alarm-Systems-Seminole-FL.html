<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that allows more light to enter the camera's sensor. The more light that is allowed to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now feature infrared light that is undetectable to the human eye but can be gotten by a security camera's sensing unit.</p>
