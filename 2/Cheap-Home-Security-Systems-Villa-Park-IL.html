<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential offenders are less likely to devote criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a greater threat of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to upset can be lowered by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
