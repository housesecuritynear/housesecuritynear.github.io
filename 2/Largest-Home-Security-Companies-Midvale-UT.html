<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
