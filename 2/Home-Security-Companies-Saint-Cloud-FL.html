Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no gaps in between.
