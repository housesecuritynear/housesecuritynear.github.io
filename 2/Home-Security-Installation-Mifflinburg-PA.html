<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.
