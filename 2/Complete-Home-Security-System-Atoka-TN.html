<p>Home security systems and contemporary smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. For some, that may deserve the $300 price.

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles frequently pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
