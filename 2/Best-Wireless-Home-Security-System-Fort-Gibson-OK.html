This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not capture and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has actually limited usefulness.</p>
