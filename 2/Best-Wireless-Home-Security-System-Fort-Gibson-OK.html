Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not capture and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has actually limited usefulness.</p>
