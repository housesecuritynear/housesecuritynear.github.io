Simply think just how much information you give away when you do an easy online grocery order: your name, your address, the kind of things you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You may even offer directions on how to enter into your structure. As just recently as ten years ago, consumers did not have access to innovation that let them manage their own home security systems.
