<p>Most security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They usually have the very same functions like night vision or remote viewing, however they differ in durability. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in some cases, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most durable. Since their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives.

This will offer more precise and less regular alerts because many times the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
