<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common.

With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

Having all this technology interact makes living simpler.</p>
