<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply only to NVR systems, but they cut out other components that would be essential for a DVR system, like additional source of power and the BNC cable televisions used to connect cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you connect a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a source of power and a method of transferring information to your NVR all in one package. When picking which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the most significant consideration. The next factor to consider is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
