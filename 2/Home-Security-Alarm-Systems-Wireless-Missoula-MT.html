It likewise offers reliable video quality and response speed.

A lot of smart cameras can be configured to do things like this, however few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
