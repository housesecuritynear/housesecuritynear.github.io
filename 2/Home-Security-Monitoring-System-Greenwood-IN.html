When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to warrant police action.</p>
