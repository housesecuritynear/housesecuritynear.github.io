However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present recommendation.</p>
