<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
