Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is costly, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The main advantage of unmonitored security systems is cost.
