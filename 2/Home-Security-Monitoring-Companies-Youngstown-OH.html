<h3>Security Cameras Wireless in Youngstown OH</h3>
<p>I described that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
