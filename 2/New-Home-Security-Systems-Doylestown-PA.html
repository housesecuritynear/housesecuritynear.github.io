It likewise includes two days of free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
