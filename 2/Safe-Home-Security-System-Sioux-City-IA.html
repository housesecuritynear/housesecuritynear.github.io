<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to manage practically every element of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable.

<p>Most security cameras can be utilized both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the same features like night vision or remote viewing, however they vary in durability. Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most resilient. Because their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options.
