<p>It is essential to know that the Brinks of the past isn't the same company as the Brinks these days.

Alarm system permits require a one-time registration fee of $45. There is no yearly renewal fee and the permit stays in place as long as the alarm system remains in use at the very same address. In our opinion, Protect America's biggest disadvantage is its three-year minimum agreement. However there's a plus side: Once you go into the contract, Protect America supplies the necessary home security equipment totally free without extra upfront costs. You're only accountable for the month-to-month monitoring charge and any optional upgrades. There's also a cost match assurance.</p>
