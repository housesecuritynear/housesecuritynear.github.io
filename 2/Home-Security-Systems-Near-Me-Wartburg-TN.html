In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during heavy traffic. After the terrible attacks, authorities examined CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying knapsacks filled with explosives. The terrorists were taped on numerous CCTV cameras, but regrettably they were neither noticed nor obstructed before they had the ability to carry out the attacks.</p>
