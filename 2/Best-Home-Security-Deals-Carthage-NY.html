This means they normally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing individuals and things to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for trying to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and in full information. If a camera can not capture and provide a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and during the night, it has limited effectiveness.</p>
