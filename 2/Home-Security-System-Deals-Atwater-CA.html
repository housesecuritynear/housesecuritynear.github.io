<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

This isn't the cheapest SimpliSafe package, however we think the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth spending for.</p>
