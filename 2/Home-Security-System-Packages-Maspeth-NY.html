<p>Customer care is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't believe they're ever going to talk with their alarm company. We have first hand experience handling these companies (as consumers ourselves) and firmly believe that customer support is really essential. Particularly for a Do It Yourself install system, having the ability to get the phone and get a security specialist on the line quickly to assist you get setup or repair an issue, is vital.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>

A subscription also ensures that you'll be covered if you disappear for a few days. The Circle Safe Basic strategy provides 14 days of video storage for $4 per month per camera (compared to $5 for 5 days for Nest Aware).
