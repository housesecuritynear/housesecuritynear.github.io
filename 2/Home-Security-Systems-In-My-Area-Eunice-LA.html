<p>Another method to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is similar in performance to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software application Unlike PCs, a lot of DVRs created for CCTV purposes are ingrained devices that require less maintenance and simpler setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.

I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional handle the task and do not mind investing the money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
