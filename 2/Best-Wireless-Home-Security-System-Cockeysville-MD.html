<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a failure, but long term outages will lead to the system losing power.
