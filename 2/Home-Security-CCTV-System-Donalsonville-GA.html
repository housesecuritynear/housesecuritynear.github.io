<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Excellent clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for one month of video history.

They provide versatility in their equipment and readily available strategies, enabling homeowners to choose the security service that best matches their requirements. Sadly, there are some disadvantages to Secure America indicated by their low C- rating from BBB. A bulk of the problems center around misinformation relating to the necessary three year contract. In reality, many consumers were not conscious they were making such a long term commitment. This, combined with the extreme penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in picking Protect America as their home security service.</p>
