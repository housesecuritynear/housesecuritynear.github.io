Just moved to Los Angeles and I believe I'm going to buy a home security system for the very first time.

This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
