<p>Since Seattle's false alarm charges are so high for alarm companies, Frontpoint also offers verified reaction services. This isn't the norm for Frontpoint, as they just offer this service in select cities. In Seattle, they'll send out a contract guard to your home if desired. You only have to pay if you dispatch a guard. Prices differ. Among the challenges wise alarm systems pose to the customer is the danger of being hacked.
