<p>Now let's examine why consumer-grade cameras are typically bad night vision entertainers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it needs a light source to light up the area below it. Unfortunately, the night vision illuminators that include consumer cameras are created for short variety just and are of a repaired brightness. This implies they typically over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and objects to appear burnt out" and with no information. So much for attempting to identify the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear correctly exposed and in full detail. It has actually restricted effectiveness if a camera can not record and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it because its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
