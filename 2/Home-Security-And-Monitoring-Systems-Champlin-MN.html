<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful aggressor, because the disruption of the network avoids the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the harmful attacker to record these codes and utilize various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key caught during the network recovery.</p>
