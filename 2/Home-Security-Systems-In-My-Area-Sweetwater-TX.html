Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and enjoy it later on.

<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to store and the length of time you prepare to keep documented footage. The video is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
