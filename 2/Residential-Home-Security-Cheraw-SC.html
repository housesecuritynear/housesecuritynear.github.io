I would not suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and requiring time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional handle the job and do not mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
