<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>I am writing in appreciation and to show you my current experience with National Security Service. Keep in mind that you might not need to buy new equipment at all. Many local security suppliers like Alarm New England are able to reuse most, if not all, of your existing security system. Customers have the option to lease or buy the equipment (which features a life time warranty).
