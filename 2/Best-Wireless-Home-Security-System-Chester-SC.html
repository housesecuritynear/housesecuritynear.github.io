If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
