<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape again, which means you may be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
