<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
