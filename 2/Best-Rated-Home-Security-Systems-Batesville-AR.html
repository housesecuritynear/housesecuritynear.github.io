Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any spaces in between.
